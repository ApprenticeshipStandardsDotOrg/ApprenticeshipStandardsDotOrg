From <%= @from %>, through <%= @through %>, we've received and converted the standards you
uploaded to https://apprenticeshipstandards.org. You can now view them live in the library:

<% @source_files.each do |source_file| %>
  <% source_file.associated_occupation_standards.each do |standard| %>
    <%= standard.title %> <%= occupation_standard_url(standard, host: @host) %> from <%= source_file.filename %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
