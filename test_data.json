These frameworks define the purpose of an occupation, the job functions that are carried out to fulfill that purpose, the competencies that enable the apprentice to execute those job functions well, and the performance criteria that define the specific knowledge, skills, and personal attributes associated with high performance in the workplace. This organizational hierarchy—job purpose, job functions, competencies, performance criteria—is designed to illustrate that performing work well requires more than just acquiring discrete knowledge elements or developing a series of manual skills. To perform a job well, the employee must be able to assimilate knowledge and skills learned in various settings, recall and apply that information to the present situation, and carry out work activities using sound professional judgment, demonstrating an appropriate attitude or disposition and achieving a level of speed and accuracy necessary to meet the employer’s business need. The table below compares the terminology of Functional Analysis with that of traditional Occupational Task Analysis to illustrate the important similarities and differences. While both identify the key technical elements of an occupation, functional analysis includes the identification of behaviors, attributes, and characteristics of workers necessary to meet an employer’s expectations. Framework Terminology Traditional Task Analysis Terminology Job Function: the work activities that are Job Duties: roles and responsibilities carried out to fulfill the job purpose associated with an occupation Competency: the actions an individual Task: a unit of work or set of activities takes and the attitudes he/she displays to needed to produce some result complete those activities Performance Criteria: the specific Subtask: the independent actions taken to knowledge, skills, dispositions, attributes, perform a unit of work or activity speed, and accuracy associated with meeting the employer’s expectations COMPETENCY-BASED OCCUPATIONAL FRAMEWORKS 1 Although designed for use in competency-based apprenticeship, these Competency- Based Occupational Frameworks also support time-based apprenticeship by defining more clearly and precisely what an apprentice is expected to learn and do during the allocated time period. CBOFs are comprehensive to encompass the full range of jobs that may be performed by individuals in the same occupation. As employers or sponsors develop their individual apprenticeship programs, they can extract from or add to the framework to meet their unique organizational needs. Components of the Competency-Based Occupational Framework Occupational Overview: This section of the framework provides a description of the occupation including its purpose, the setting in which the job is performed, and unique features of the occupation. Work Process Schedule: This section includes the job functions and competencies that would likely be included in an apprenticeship sponsor’s application for registration. These frameworks provide a point of reference that has already been vetted by industry leaders so sponsors can develop new programs knowing that they will meet or exceed the consensus expectations of peers. Sponsors maintain the ability to customize their programs to meet their unique needs, but omission of a significant number of job functions or competencies should raise questions about whether or not the program has correctly identified the occupation of interest. Cross-Cutting Competencies: These competencies are common among all workers and focus on the underlying knowledge, attitudes, personal attributes, and interpersonal skills that are important regardless of the occupation. That said, while these competencies are important to all occupations, the relative importance of some versus others may change from one occupation to the next. These relative differences are illustrated in this part of the CBOF and can be used to design pre-apprenticeship programs or design effective screening tools when recruiting apprentices to the program. Detailed Job Function Analysis: This portion of the framework includes considerable detail and is designed to support curriculum designers and trainers in developing and administering the program. The detail in this section may be confusing to those seeking a more succinct, higher-level view of the program. For this reason, we recommend that the 2 COMPETENCY-BASED OCCUPATIONAL FRAMEWORKS Work Process Schedule be the focus of program planning activities, leaving the detailed job function analysis sections to instructional designers as they engage in their development work. a. Related Technical Instruction: Under each job function appears a list of foundational knowledge, skills, tools, and technologies that would likely be taught in the classroom to enable the apprentice’s on-the-job training safety and success. b. Performance Criteria: Under each competency, we provide recommended performance criteria that could be used to differentiate between minimally, moderately, and highly competent apprentices. These performance criteria are generally skills based rather than knowledge based, but may also include dispositional and behavioral competencies. Using the Competency-Based Occupational Framework to Develop a Registered Apprenticeship Program When developing a registered apprenticeship program, the Work Process Schedule included in this CBOF provides an overview of the job functions and competencies an expert peer group deemed to be important to this occupation. The Work Process Schedule in this document can be used directly, or modified and used to describe your program content and design as part of your registration application. When designing the curriculum to support the apprenticeship program—including on-the- job training and related technical instruction—the information the Detailed Job Functions section could be helpful. These more detailed job function documents include recommendations for the key knowledge and skills that might be included in the classroom instruction designed to support a given job function, and the performance criteria provided under each competency could be helpful to trainers and mentors in evaluating apprentice performance and insuring inter-rater reliability when multiple mentors are involved. COMPETENCY-BASED OCCUPATIONAL FRAMEWORKS 3 Accountant Occupational Overview Occupational Purpose and Context An accountant analyzes financial information and prepares financial reports to determine or maintain records of assets, liabilities, profits, and losses, tax liability, or other financial activities within an organization. This competency-based occupational framework is aimed at an entry-level accountant position. Accountants can work internally, within an organization, or as external collaborators. Accountants working internally may take on many roles within an organization, communicating with many other business units within the organization such as human resources and sales. Accountants may also provide specific services externally to a business, such as bookkeeping and payroll management. Accountants may take on many roles within the general scope of accounting or specialize in a particular role. This difference may relate to the size of the firm where an accountant works. Smaller firms may have more generalized accountants who cover multiple areas of work including accounts receivable and payable, general bookkeeping, maintaining information systems, inventory management, and payroll. Accountants in larger firms may only dedicate their time to one of the aforementioned areas of work. Some areas of work for accountants may require specific knowledge related to the regulatory environment and framework that determines firms’ activities. Some may need specific knowledge related to the different benefits a firm may provide privately or public benefits provided by federal, state, and local entities. For instance, a payroll accountant may require specific knowledge on labor laws; payroll taxes specific to each state, and locality; and knowledge of public and private benefits available to employees such as paid leave benefits. Potential Job Titles Accountant, Accounting Assistant, Accountant I, Junior Accountant, Junior Business Analyst, Cost Accountant, Cost Accountant Assistant, General Accountant, Project Accountant, Staff Accountant, Accounts Receivable/Payable Assistant ACCOUNTANT OCCUPATIONAL OVERVIEW 4 Attitudes and Behaviors Accountants manage, organize, analyze, and communicate the financial information of an organization. Their work thus requires the ability to communicate clearly, cooperation with others within a team and across business units within an organization, accuracy and attention to detail, adaptability and flexibility, integrity, and a willingness to learn. Accountants must be able to communicate clearly to their peers and senior colleagues. They must communicate complex information in a clear and understandable way, providing the precise information others request. When communicating, they will exhibit appropriate deference to more experienced colleagues, while maintaining respectful communication overall with internal and external stakeholders. Accountants will also work in concert with other business units and external customers and vendors. They must be able to work well in teams and manage their time and efforts accordingly. Adaptability is another important aspect, as accountants in smaller firms may have to assume more than one role and switch between multiple, mutually exclusive or related tasks and projects. Finally, because accountants lead the financial reporting and provision of financial information to assess the health of a business, they must have a high degree of integrity. Maintaining honest accounts of expenditures and incomes, values of existing assets, and accounting costs is important for keeping the true state of a business transparent. Apprenticeship Prerequisites N/A Occupational Pathways Professional accountants usually require a bachelor’s degree, although this is not always the case. Once an apprentice has completed an accountant apprenticeship program, they may seek to gain work experience and/or further their credentials by obtaining a bachelor’s degree. Once the degree is obtained, an accountant may certify as a Certified Public Accountant, or any of the other professional certifications listed in the following section.

Still, the relative importance of specific cross-cutting competencies differs from occupation to occupation. The cross-cutting competencies table, above, provides information about which of these competencies is most important to be successful in a particular occupation. This information can be useful to employers or intermediaries in screening and selecting candidates for apprenticeship programs, or to pre-apprenticeship providers who seek to prepare individuals for successful entry into an apprenticeship program. The scoring system utilized to evaluate competency levels required in each cross-cutting skill aligns with the recommendations of the Lumina Foundation’s Connecting Credentials Framework.

ABOUT THE URBAN INSTITUTE The nonprofit Urban Institute is dedicated to elevating the debate on social and economic policy. For nearly five decades, Urban scholars have conducted research and offered evidence-based solutions that improve lives and strengthen communities across a rapidly urbanizing world. Their objective research helps expand opportunities for all, reduce hardship among the most vulnerable, and strengthen the effectiveness of the public sector. Acknowledgments We would like to thank numerous people who have contributed to the development and vetting of this national occupational framework: Sarah R. James, DML, Executive Director & Past President, SOLE –The International Society of Logistics Dave Harrison, SME, Executive Director of Workforce Development, FASTPORT Matt Wright, Director of Human Resources for Technical and Production, Nestlé USA Cheryl Garr, MA, Mission Advancement Director, Goodwill Keystone Area Sue Soderberg, Chief Mission Officer, Goodwill Keystone Area John J. Erb, DML, President, SOLE –The International Society of Logistics William A. Evans, DML, Space Logistics Coordinator, SOLE –The International Society of Logistics Introduction to Using This Document Under the Registered Apprenticeship Technical Assistance Centers of Excellence award, the Urban Institute leads the Occupations and Standards work. One of the main objectives of Urban’s project is to create high-quality, well-researched, consensus-based work process schedules that are nonproprietary and widely available. This document is a product of that work and contains three sections: the occupational overview, the work process schedule, and the related technical instruction. The occupational overview is a general introduction, including alternative job titles, any prerequisites, and, if applicable, the total number of hours needed to complete a time- based or hybrid program. The work process schedule outlines the major job functions, competencies, and/or hours an apprentice completes in a registered apprenticeship program. It outlines what apprentices are expected to learn on the job with the support of a mentor or journeyworker, including both core competencies and those deemed optional by experts in the field. The work process schedule is the foundational document guiding a program. Urban works with numerous experts to ensure the content is thoroughly researched and vetted to reflect the expectations of industry, educators, unions, and others for this occupation. Sponsors and others can use the work process schedule as their program standards with assurances it has been approved by experts in the field. The related technical instruction presents considerations for the coursework that apprentices will undertake to supplement on-the-job learning. It is intended to serve as a reference to sponsors exploring their options for the accompanying classroom, virtual, or hybrid training. How to Use the Work Process Schedule Sponsors can adapt the work process schedule to accommodate their needs for competency- or time-based or hybrid programs. In a competency-based apprenticeship, sponsors assess apprentices’ progress across core and optional competencies listed in the work process schedule. In a time-based apprenticeship, apprentices complete a predetermined number of hours across major job functions and the program overall. In a hybrid apprenticeship, sponsors monitor apprentices’ hours spent on major job functions and assess their proficiency across competencies. Each program type has a different method of assessment:  For a competency-based program, apprentices engage in activities and make progress toward proficiency in the identified competencies. Sponsors overseeing apprentices’ work assess their mastery of the outlined competencies using the following rating scale: 4—Competent/proficient (able to perform all elements of the task successfully and independently) 3—Satisfactory performance (able to perform elements of the task with minimal assistance) 2—Completed the task with significant assistance 1—Unsuccessfully attempted the task 0—No exposure (note the reason—absence, skill isn’t covered, etc.) The competencies may be completed in any order. Apprentices must perform at a level 4 or 3 in all competencies listed as “core” to complete the apprenticeship program successfully.  For a time-based program, sponsors monitor apprentices’ completion of hours in training across major job functions. The total number of hours recommended for this occupation is listed in the occupational overview and is based on guidance from the US Department of Labor. Generally, apprentices must have at least 2,000 hours overall for on-the-job learning, but occupations of greater complexity, such as human resources specialist, may require more hours. Sponsors will provide apprentices with supervised work experience and allocate the total number of hours across the major job functions to adequately train their apprentices.  The hybrid approach blends both competency- and time-based strategies. Sponsors measure apprentices’ skills acquisition through a combination of completing the minimum hours of on-the-job learning successfully demonstrating identified competencies. Sponsors will assess apprentices’ proficiencies as described for competency-based programs with a rating scale of 0–4 for every core competency. Generally, apprentices have at least 2,000 hours overall for on-the-job learning, but occupations of greater complexity may require more hours. Sponsors will document apprentices’ completion within a minimum and maximum range of hours assigned for each major job function. Supply Technician Occupational Overview Occupational Purpose and Context Supply technicians perform work necessary to support the effective operation of ongoing supply activities. They coordinate inventory and the maintenance of supplies and equipment, prepare supply orders, inspect supplies, maintain accurate reporting and records, communicate with suppliers and customers, and carry out quality control activities in accordance with established methods and techniques, organizational policies, and applicable government laws or regulations. Supply technicians are part of the field of supply management, one of five functional domains of logistics: logistics engineering, supply management, maintenance management, distribution and transportation, and logistics services. Potential Job Titles Central supply technician, supply chain technician, logistics analyst, repair parts technician, automated supply systems technician, inventory technician, inventory control technician Apprenticeship Prerequisites Apprentices should be able to speak and write in English (and/or in the native language of international suppliers) and be US citizens or eligible noncitizens. A high school diploma or equivalent is generally required. 1 The ONET code for logistics analyst is included here because of the absence of a specific code for occupations that fall under supply management. We acknowledge that someone working as a logistics analyst would perform duties across all five domains of logistic work beyond the scope of duties expected of a supply technician, which is the focus of this national occupational framework. Additional distinct work process schedules would be necessary to cover apprenticeable occupations aligned with other domains of logistics work (e.g., warehouse technician) that are beyond the scope of the job functions and competencies expected of a supply technician. Recommended Length of Apprenticeship (Time/Hybrid Programs Only) N/A Supply Technician ONET Code: 13- 1081.02 Program type (time-based, competency-based, hybrid): RAPIDS Code: 3046 Work Process Schedule Instructions for Use: Competency-based programs: In the “performance level achieved” column of the work process schedule (see examples starting on the next page), assess apprentices’ performances on each competency with the scale below. No monitoring of hours is required for this approach. See “Guidelines for Competency-Based, Hybrid and Time-Based Apprenticeship Training Approaches,” US Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship, October 20, 2015, https://www.apprenticeship.gov/sites/default/files/bulletins/Cir2016-01.pdf. 4—Competent/proficient (able to perform all elements of the task successfully and independently) 3—Satisfactory performance (able to perform elements of the task with minimal assistance) 2—Completed the task with significant assistance 1—Unsuccessfully attempted the task 0—No exposure (note the reason—absence, skill isn’t covered, etc.) Time-based programs: In the “hours” row, specify the number of hours apprentices will fulfill for each job function. No assessment of competencies is required for this approach. Hybrid programs: In the “performance level achieved” column, assess apprentices’ performances on each competency using the 0–4 scale above.

Courses offered by accredited colleges and universities may be assigned a credit hour determination rather than a contact hour determination. In general, an academic credit unit is the equivalent of 15 clock hours of instruction. Development and Use of This RTI Outline: Employers and academic institutions may approach RTI in markedly different ways. Our goal was not to identify the single best way to provide RTI or to identify a single provider whose content we deemed to be superior. Instead, our goal was to survey numerous education providers, including employers, institutions of higher education, high schools, private continuing education providers, labor organizations, professional associations and, in some cases, municipalities that provide worker training, to identify topics or courses common among those providers that align with the job functions included in this work process schedule. Those common topics or courses are reflected in the RTI outline provided below, which may be useful in developing your RTI program or communicating your needs to an educational partner. Licensure or certification requirements: Licensure or certification is not typically required for entry into this occupation. Degree requirements for licensure or certification, if applicable: Not applicable Accreditation requirements of instructional provider for licensure or certification, if applicable: Not applicable Anticipated changes in licensure or certification requirements, if known: None Examples of state licensure or certification requirements: Not applicable Examples of RTI providers for this occupation  Professional associations and labor organizations:  The Association for Supply Chain Management provides certification opportunities in production and inventory management (certified in production and inventory management, or CPIM) and logistics, transportation, and distribution (certified in logistics, transportation, and distribution, or CLTD). The Institute for Supply Management provides certification opportunities in supply management (certified professional in supply management, or CPSM) and supplier diversity (certified professional in supplier diversity, or CPSD). Employers: Numerous employers have initiated training programs focused on developing supply and warehouse technicians. For example, Goodwill Keystone Area (in partnership with Harrisburg Area Community College) offers logistics technician apprenticeships to prepare individuals for warehouse positions; FASTPORT supports apprenticeships in transportation, distribution, and logistics; and Nestlé USA offers entry-level apprenticeships in warehousing, shipping and receiving, and transportation. Other employers include GlaxoSmithKline LLC, Eli Lilly Indianapolis, STOBER Drives Inc. (Maysville, KY), and others. Military: The Defense Acquisition University offers a large selection of online and in-person courses in supply chain management, logistics, and transportation. These classes are available to military personnel and employers who serve as Department of Defense contractors. States/municipalities: None Colleges and universities: College and university programs in supply chain management are typically offered by schools of business through their graduate or executive education programs. These courses are usually designed for intermediate or advanced learners. Some community colleges offer certificate programs in logistics and warehousing, although those programs may include just three or four classes and may not be eligible for federal student aid or college credit. No-cost online providers (note that many no-cost online providers permit students to enroll free of charge, but if students wish to actively participate in the course, receive a grade for the course, document completion of the course, or earn credit for the course, they may be required to pay a substantial fee): Coursera and edX offer several basic business classes and supply chain and logistics courses for beginner, intermediate, and advanced students. Examples of providers that offer logistics and supply chain management courses via Coursera include Rutgers University (Coursera’s primary provider), the University of Colorado, and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Examples of providers that offer logistics courses through edX include Arizona State University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Delft University of Technology (Netherlands). For more information, visit https://www.edx.org/learn/logistics and https://www.coursera.org/courses? query=logistics. Continuing education or specialty education providers: Numerous organizations provide specialty and business-to-business education and training in logistics, including the Logistics Training Center (https://www.logisticstrainingcenter.com/), Udemy.com (https://www.udemy.com/course/warehouse-management-in-logistics-supply-chain- management/), BMC.net (https://www.bmc.net/training/10/Warehouse-,-Logistics-,- Supply-Chain-and-Inventory), and Camcode.com (https://www.camcode.com/blog/warehouse-operations-courses/).

Relevant military experience  Unit supply specialists (MOS 92Y) receive, inspect, inventory, load and unload, store, issue, and deliver supplies. Diversity, equity, and inclusion  The supply chain industry suffers from a lack of gender diversity. However, a 2021 Gartner survey of women in supply chain showed that despite widespread challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, participation by women in this industry increased from 37 percent in 2018 to 41 percent in 2021. Increased participation by women in more senior roles, however, grew at a slower rate, having peaked between 2019 and 2020 before declining in 2022. For example, the representation of women in vice president and senior director roles increased from 20 percent in 2018 to 23 percent in 2021, though the share peaked at 28 percent in 2019. The study showed that 73 percent of respondent companies have gender-related diversity, equity, and inclusion goals, though only 29 percent have formal targets and specific goals on management scorecards. Unfortunately, the survey showed that retaining midcareer women employees was a challenge, largely because of the lack of career opportunities available to such employees (Sarah Hippold, “Gartner Survey Finds Women Comprise 41% of the Supply Chain Workforce: Lack of Career Opportunities Biggest Challenge for Retaining Midcareer Women,” Gartner, June 16, 2021, https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-06-16-gartner-survey-finds- women-comprise-41-percent-of-the-supply-chain-workforce).

STATEMENT OF INDEPENDENCE The Urban Institute strives to meet the highest standards of integrity and quality in its research and analyses and in the evidence-based policy recommendations offered by its researchers and experts. We believe that operating consistent with the values of independence, rigor, and transparency is essential to maintaining those standards. As an organization, the Urban Institute does not take positions on issues, but it does empower and support its experts in sharing their own evidence-based views and policy recommendations that have been shaped by scholarship. Funders do not determine our research findings or the insights and recommendations of our experts. Urban scholars and experts are expected to be objective and follow the evidence wherever it may lead."

      "content": "ON THE JOB LEARNING OUTCOMES (aka work process schedule) Medical Interpreter SOC: 27.3091 RAPIDS CODE: _____ Medical Interpreter Role Definition : The primary function of the medical interpreter is to make possible communication between a health care provider and a patient who do not speak the same language. In performing this function, the medical interpreter’s commitment is to the goals of the clinical interview. The presence of the interpreter makes it possible for the patient and provider to achieve the goals of their encounter as if they were communicating directly with each other. As defined by the International Medical Interpreters Association Standards of Practice On the Job Learning Hours/Rotations/Expectations: Hours Apprentices will work approximately 20 hours per week as Medical Interpreters. The Medical Interpreter role is intended to be part-time, above and beyond the Apprentices’ full-time jobs at the hospital. Rotations Apprentices will begin their OJL after they have completed and passed a front-loaded 60-hour course in the Fundamentals of Medical Interpreting. OJL will begin in a location of lower complexity and will advance gradually to locations of greater complexity. By the end of the apprenticeship program, the expectation is that the Medical Interpreter Apprentices will be fully competent to provide Interpreter Services at any location within Women & Infants Hospital. Expectations Apprentices will work their Medical Interpreting OJL shifts in pairs whenever possible. A mentor/preceptor will be located on site or available via phone. If there are not patients in need of medical interpreter services during an Apprentice’s OJL shift, they may observe or practice with their Apprentice peer. Apprentices are responsible for tracking their OJL and indicating whether they were observing, practicing with a peer or providing direct services to a patient. Preceptor/Mentor For the first cohort of apprentices, a preceptor/mentor will be available on-site and by phone through U- Mass Medical School. After the first cohort, the current Medical Interpreters will be trained to be preceptors/mentors for future cohorts. On the Job Learning Competency Measures : Apprentice Self-Assessment Apprentices will be evaluated on a weekly and monthly basis. Apprentices will keep a daily journal and will complete a weekly self –assessment of their skills& competencies. In addition, they will complete an Interpreter checklist every time they are engaged inOJL. Preceptor/Supervisor Assessment Preceptor/Mentor will meet individually with Apprentices every week and will conduct a performance review and skills assessment. In addition, the Preceptor and Supervisor will track OJL competencies on an ongoing basis with a monthly formal assessment with the Apprentice. Competency Checklist : Competencies are defined by the International Medical Interpreters Association Standards of Practice Mastery of OJL competencies will be evaluated on a Likert Scale as follows: 4 = Above Standard 3 = Meets Standard 2 = Below Standard 1= Doesn’t meet Standard Competency/Skill Competency Supervisor Rating: 1-4 Initials INTERPRETATION – 1000-1200 hours (approx.)
